# huggingface-learning-notes

Most content are from [HuggingFace's official documentation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) plus some of my exploration. I've left out some tasks which are not relevant to me at the moment to keep it short.

This is a self-study note, I don't expect it to be useful to others. For the complete reference, please visit the official tutorials and documentation instead.
